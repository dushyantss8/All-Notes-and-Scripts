# DevOps Fundamentals

1. What is DevOps
2. Why DevOps exists
3. How to introduce yourself as a DevOps Engineer
4. What a DevOps Engineer does day-to-day

These are **frequently asked interview questions**, often asked within the **first 5 minutes** of a DevOps interview.

---

## 1. What Is DevOps?

### 1.1 DevOps Is Not a Tool – It Is a Culture

DevOps is **not**:

* A single tool
* Only CI/CD
* Only automation

DevOps is a **culture and set of practices** adopted by an organization to **improve application delivery**.

### Simple One-Line Definition

> **DevOps is a culture and process that improves an organization’s ability to deliver applications faster and more reliably.**

---

## 2. Why Delivery Speed Matters (Real-World Examples)

### Example 1: Application Updates

If a company takes **10 days** to move an application from:

* Version V1 → Version V2
  that is inefficient.

With DevOps, the same change should ideally be delivered in:

* Hours
* 1–2 days
* Or even minutes

### Example 2: Security Fixes (Android Example)

If a security vulnerability is found:

* Users expect **immediate updates**
* Auto-updates happen quickly

This fast, safe, reliable delivery is the **core goal of DevOps**.

---

## 3. Is DevOps Only About Delivery?

**No. Delivery speed alone is not enough.**

To deliver faster **without breaking quality**, DevOps focuses on **four key pillars**.

---

## 4. The Four Pillars of DevOps

### 4.1 Automation

* Reduce manual work
* Automate builds, deployments, infrastructure
* Example: CI/CD pipelines instead of manual deployments

### 4.2 Quality

* Faster delivery should not reduce reliability
* Code and application quality must be maintained

### 4.3 Monitoring (Observability)

* Detect failures, performance issues, downtime
* Ensure systems behave as expected
* Monitoring helps teams **react quickly**

### 4.4 Continuous Testing

* Testing ensures:

  * Automation works correctly
  * Quality is maintained
* Testing must be integrated continuously, not done at the end

---

## 5. Ideal DevOps Definition (Interview-Ready)

> **DevOps is a process of improving application delivery by ensuring proper automation, maintaining quality, enabling continuous monitoring, and implementing continuous testing.**

This definition is:

* Beginner-friendly
* Interview-safe
* Conceptually correct

---

## 6. Expected Outcome of DevOps

### Business Expectation

If an application release cycle is:

* **2 weeks today**

After DevOps adoption, the expectation is:

* **1 week or less**
* Without compromising quality

### DevOps Engineer’s Goal

* Eliminate manual steps
* Speed up delivery
* Improve reliability and stability

---

## 7. Why DevOps Came Into Existence

### 7.1 How Things Worked Before DevOps (10 Years Ago)

Delivering an application involved **multiple roles**:

1. **Developer**

   * Writes code
   * Pushes to centralized repository (SVN/CVS)

2. **System Administrator**

   * Creates servers (bare metal, VMware, OpenStack)
   * Installs OS and application servers

3. **Build & Release Engineer**

   * Deploys application
   * Promotes builds across environments

4. **Tester**

   * Tests application on servers

### Result:

* Too many handoffs
* Manual processes
* Slow delivery (10 days, weeks, or months)

---

## 8. Problem With the Old Model

* Multiple teams
* Manual effort
* Poor communication
* Slow releases

👉 **Manual processes = slow delivery**

---

## 9. How DevOps Solves This Problem

DevOps:

* Combines responsibilities into **one collaborative team**
* Automates infrastructure, testing, and deployment
* Removes silos

### Why DevOps Is Called a “Culture”

* Tools change frequently
* Engineers must **adapt continuously**
* Focus is on improving efficiency, not rigid processes

---

## 10. How to Introduce Yourself as a DevOps Engineer (Interview Guide)

### 10.1 Key Rules

* Do **not lie** about experience
* Do **not claim 10+ years of DevOps experience**
* DevOps became mainstream only in the last 7–8 years

---

### 10.2 Sample Introduction (Experienced Candidate)

> “I am a DevOps Engineer with 4–5 years of experience. Before transitioning into DevOps, I worked as a System Administrator / Build & Release Engineer. Currently, I focus on automating application delivery, maintaining quality, implementing continuous monitoring, and integrating testing into the DevOps lifecycle.”

---

### 10.3 Sample Introduction (Fresher)

> “I recently started my journey as a DevOps Engineer. I am passionate about automation, CI/CD, and improving application delivery. I am actively learning DevOps concepts and tools and applying them through hands-on practice.”

---

### 10.4 Why Background Matters

Your past experience helps interviewers understand:

* Where you add value
* How quickly you can adapt

Examples:

* System Admin → Cloud & Infrastructure
* Developer → CI/CD & automation
* Automation Engineer → Testing pipelines

---

## 11. Should You Mention Tools in Introduction?

**Optional. Not recommended for beginners.**

If asked, you can mention:

* CI/CD: GitHub Actions
* Containers: Kubernetes
* Config Management: Ansible
* Infra as Code: Terraform

---

## 12. What to Do After Day 1 (Instructions)

1. Google “What is DevOps”
2. Read blogs and compare definitions
3. Notice recurring themes:

   * Automation
   * Quality
   * Monitoring
   * Testing
4. Post questions or insights in comments
5. Prepare a **clean, honest DevOps introduction**

---

## 13. What’s Coming Next (Day 2 Preview)

* Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
* Role of DevOps in SDLC
* Recap of Day 1
* Answering viewer questions

---

## 14. Key Takeaways

* DevOps is a **culture**, not a tool
* Goal: **Faster, reliable delivery**
* Four pillars:
  **Automation, Quality, Monitoring, Testing**
* DevOps evolved to eliminate manual, slow processes
* Clear self-introduction is critical in interviews
